 This is a basic blackjack game code in Java with object-oriented programming

 ## Inside the Game
 - The game is you against the bank and you start with 100 buckets to bet
 - The game ends when you press '-1' or when you hit 0 buckets or the cards in the decks run out
 - You can win, draw or lose. The bank is fair, be smart and try to win! ðŸ‘¾
